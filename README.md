# SQL-Essentials
This contains all SQL queries that I learned as a part of Data Analyst Bootcamp for quick reference - including a Data Cleaning and Exploration done using SQL.

It is spanned from the basic commands like the SELECT, INSERT and WHERE and spans towards the Intermediate and Advanced SQL commands Like the Common Table Expression, Subqueries, Window Functions and more.
